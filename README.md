Hi. I'm Katera Dunga, an ALX Software Engineering student. I'm also a Geological Engineering Student. My aim is to combine the two and create Geo-technology. I'm excited to be here and looking forward to learn allot.
Also really looking forward to working with the community here to successfully complete the program.
